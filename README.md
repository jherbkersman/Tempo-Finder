# Tempo-Finder

The python program in the main folder is a VERY simple  program you can run and use to find the tempo (BPM) of songs. The program accepts user metronome input in the form of tapping ENTER repeatedly. This was my first attempt at this idea; I needed a better way of determining the tempo of songs I was writing in order to set the recording metronome click frequency.

Side note for python version: The computation of the BPM is computed from the average of the last ten taps. To increase or decrease this number (for less or more frequent adjustments to the estimated BPM), simply modify the number "10" in line 11.

UPDATE: V2.0 (or V0.2 if we're being honest)
I re-wrote this in swift as my first MacOS App so I wouldn't have to access terminal every time I wanted to use the program. It is not pretty, clean, or have more than one feature, but it works! I included the app & source code the best I could in this repository, but even with my limited knowledge of app disribution, I don't think you'll be able to download and run it. If you want the fully built version of my app for free just shoot me a message or email and I'll send it over to you!
