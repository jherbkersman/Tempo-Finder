# Tempo-Finder

This is a VERY simple python program you can run and use to find the tempo (BPM) of songs. The program accepts user metronome input in the form of tapping ENTER repeatedly.

The computation of the BPM is computed from the average of the last ten taps. To increase or decrease this number (for less or more frequent adjustments to the estimated BPM), simply modify the number "10" in line 11.
